Hi !!
I am a masters student at <a href="www.usu.edu" target="_blank">Utah State University</a>, Computer Science. I like Logan city as it is close to the nature with beautiful summer. Camping and fishing are at the top of my to do list. I also work for <a href="http://idias.usu.edu/" target="_blank">IDIAS</a> with <a href="http://itls.usu.edu/htm/profile&brett-shelton" target="_blank">Dr. Brett Shelton</a>.

<p>
I am still learning how to be a better programmer and honestly, I try to learn by seeing how other good programmers code. I mostly write code in C# and Ruby
</p>

<p>
Surprisingly, my under grad was in Electronics & Communication, India, (2003 - 2007). Yes, I know a little about 8086 and those scary mosfets. After completing my under grad, I started working with Wipro Technologies (WT), India, as a Java developer. After working for 2.5 years I realised the importance of a masters degree and started explored my options for masters degree in Computer Science. 
<br>
This was my gateway to Utah State University.
